Quake bsp map converter tool

![Image](/screenshots/a.png)

Tested on maps from https://lvlworld.com/
I did not encounter any that do not work yet. If you do, please create a new issue.

Currently only Quake 3 (IBSP 46) and Quake Live (IBSP 47) maps are supported. The BSP map loader source code is located here: https://github.com/cartman300/Libraria/blob/master/LibSerialization/Formats/BSP.cs
